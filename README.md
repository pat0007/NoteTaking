# User Stories
1) As a user, I want to tap the empty field at the top of the screen. The system will respond by raising the keyboard. As a user I want to type my notes into this text field at the top of the screen. I will then press the "+" button when I am done typing to add the note to the screen below. The system will respond by placing the note below any other notes that may already exist in the notes field. If no notes exist yet, it will simply place the note at the top of the notes field.
