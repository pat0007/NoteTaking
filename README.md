1) As a user, I want to tap the empty field at the top of the screen. The system will respond by raising the keyboard. As a user I want to type my notes into this text field at the top of the screen. I will then press the "+" button when I am done typing to add the note to the screen below. The system will respond by placing the note below any other notes that may already exist in the notes field. If no notes exist yet, it will simply place the note at the top of the notes field.

2) As a user, I want to tap on an existing note to edit it. This will raise the keyboard and the cursor to inform me where Iâ€™m typing. I will edit the note and when I'm done, I can simply tap anywhere else on the screen to stop editing that note. The system will respond by updating the note in that field.

3) As a user, I want to delete an existing note. There exists a delete button underneath the note that allows me to easily delete any note that I have previously typed. The system will respond by removing that note from the list of notes, and pushing all other notes up toward the top of the field.
